abstract = {The recent developments in the modern data collection tools, techniques, and storage capabilities are leading towards huge volume of data. The dimensions of data indicate the number of features that have been measured for each observation. It has become a challenging task to analyze high dimensional data. Different dimensionality reduction techniques are available in literature to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features. Selection of an appropriate dimension reduction technique can help to enhance the processing speed and reduce the time and effort required to extract valuable information. This paper presents the state-of-the art dimensionality reduction techniques and their suitability for different types of data and application areas. Furthermore, the issues of dimensionality reduction techniques have been highlighted that can affect the accuracy and relevance of results.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new density-based clustering algorithm, ST-DBSCAN, which is based on DBSCAN. We propose three marginal extensions to DBSCAN related with the identification of (i) core objects, (ii) noise objects, and (iii) adjacent clusters. In contrast to the existing density-based clustering algorithms, our algorithm has the ability of discovering clusters according to non-spatial, spatial and temporal values of the objects. In this paper, we also present a spatial–temporal data warehouse system designed for storing and clustering a wide range of spatial–temporal data. We show an implementation of our algorithm by using this data warehouse and present the data mining results.}

abstract = {This paper provides a short overview of space–time series clustering, which can be generally grouped into three main categories such as: hierarchical, partitioning-based, and overlapping clustering. The first hierarchical category is to identify hierarchies in space–time series data. The second partitioning-based category focuses on determining disjoint partitions among the space–time series data, whereas the third overlapping category explores fuzzy logic to determine the different correlations between the space–time series clusters. We also further describe solutions for each category in this paper. Furthermore, we show the applications of these solutions in an urban traffic data captured on two urban smart cities (e.g., Odense in Denmark and Beijing in China). The perspectives on open questions and research challenges are also mentioned and discussed that allow to obtain a better understanding of the intuition, limitations, and benefits for the various space–time series clustering methods. This work can thus provide the guidances to practitioners for selecting the most suitable methods for their used cases, domains, and applications.}

abstract = {Current software tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data, on the one hand, utilize the opportunities provided by modern computer technologies, on the other hand, incorporate the legacy from the conventional cartography. We have considered existing visualization-based techniques for exploratory analysis of spatio-temporal data from two perspectives: (1) what types of spatio-temporal data they are applicable to; (2) what exploratory tasks they can potentially support. The technique investigation has been based on an operational typology of spatio-temporal data and analytical tasks we specially devised for this purpose. The result of the study is a structured inventory of existing exploratory techniques related to the types of data and tasks they are appropriate for. This result is potentially helpful for data analysts—users of geovisualization tools: it provides guidelines for selection of proper exploratory techniques depending on the characteristics of data to analyze and the goals of analysis. At the same time the inventory as well as the suggested typology of tasks could be useful for tool designers and developers of various domain-specific geovisualization applications. The designers can, on the one hand, see what task types are insufficiently supported by the existing tools and direct their creative activities towards filling the gaps, on the other hand, use the techniques described as basic elements for building new, more sophisticated ones. The application developers can, on the one hand, use the task and data typology in the analysis of potential user needs, on the other hand, appropriately select and combine existing tools in order to satisfy these needs.},

    abstract = { When it comes to designing animated maps, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, the software, or the data – it is the limited visual and cognitive processing capabilities of the map reader. Only sporadic progress has been made within GIScience in answering even the most basic questions: Under what conditions and for what kinds of map-reading tasks are animated maps effective, and how can their effectiveness be increased? Fortunately, over the past 20 years cognitive researchers in psychology and education have created a comprehensive set of theories that explain how people look at and learn from dynamic images, under what conditions these images work or fail, and why. Moreover, numerous controlled experiments, often designed to replicate and build upon previous studies, have validated these theories (something that is rare in cartography). This article presents a synthesis of this research and shows how it (1) directly informs mapping practices, (2) explains important cognitive differences between static and animated maps, (3) provides much-needed empirical support for emerging cartographic practices (where testing has yet to be done), and (4) generally confirms results from previous map studies. The article outlines solutions to split attention, retroactive inhibition, and cognitive overload. It also champions a perceptual–cognitive approach to cartography that would allow us to can explain why our designs work and not merely whether they work. Given the sizeable investment and number of animated maps in use today, such insights seem highly relevant. }
