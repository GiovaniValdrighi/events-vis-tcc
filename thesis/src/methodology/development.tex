\section{Development}

The main goal of this work is to present a novel technique for visualizing events with space and time information but keeping most of this 3D distribution (i.e., longitude, latitude, and time) in a 2D plot.
%

Inspired by the work done in MotionRugs~\cite{Buchmuller2019} and from Max Franke et.al.~\cite{franke2021visual} in spatio-temporal visualization where it is created a heatmap with the time in one axis and the bi-dimensional space represented in the other, 
%
it was desired to develop a method with this characteristic that was able to represent events and their areas, intersections areas, and that were not observed the complete time period.
